### Partition

### LogFile 
Contains newly written series as an in-memory index and is persisted as WAL.
### IndexFile
Contains an immutable, memory-mapped index built from a LogFile or merged from two contiguous index filesï¼Ÿ
### SeriesFile
It could also be named as `SeriesKeyFile`, for it stores keys(measurement + tag set) for all series, and shared by all shards, across the entire database.

# Question:
1. This function returns a bitmap rather than list of series ID, how will it be used?  
Bitmap is not bloom filter.
